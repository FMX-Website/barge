If your goal is a system that feels **natural, responsive, professional, and production-safe**, the **best overall approach is a hybrid of intent-based + natural interruption**, with **wake-word as an optional fallback**, not the primary mechanism. Wake-word alone is the most reliable for avoiding false triggers, but it’s less human and slows conversations because the user must explicitly address the agent every time. Free natural interruption feels the most human, but it depends heavily on VAD, ASR confidence, diarization, and semantic understanding, and without guardrails it can over-trigger in noisy environments or during side conversations. Intent-based interruption sits in the sweet spot: it listens continuously in full-duplex, detects when speech is present, performs low-latency partial transcription, evaluates the meaning of the utterance, and only interrupts TTS if the words appear directed at the AI (commands, objections, corrections, questions, stop phrases, or contextual references). This means the AI won’t stop just because someone coughs or talks in the background, but *will* stop when the user actually begins interacting with it naturally — “hold on,” “no wait,” “actually what I meant was…” or when the user simply starts asking a new question. Adding wake-word support as a secondary fallback ensures reliability in edge cases, but doesn’t burden the main interaction flow.

For a senior engineer: Think of it as a tiered gating system instead of an on/off switch. Raw audio first goes through VAD and energy detection to confirm that speech — not noise — is present. Instead of stopping the TTS immediately, the system streams that audio to a partial real-time recognizer. It then performs a lightweight semantic check to evaluate whether the speech is cognitively addressed to the AI. Only when the text shows intent — a command, a question, an objection, or a redirection — does the TTS get cancelled and the agent returns to listening state. In practical terms, this is the same as prioritizing conversational agent intent over acoustic triggers. You still maintain continuous listening like a full-duplex system, but interruption becomes meaning-driven instead of sound-driven. That yields a personal-assistant feel instead of an IVR tree, while keeping robustness by avoiding false barge-ins from random noises or conversations in the room. The overall experience is fluid: the AI speaks confidently, the user can cut in naturally when they want, and the system only yields when it makes sense — functioning more like a trained call-center agent than a naive sound-reactive bot.


The best overall strategy remains **intent-based natural interruption with wake-word as a fallback**, but now extended with a **graceful interruption acknowledgment and recovery mechanism**. When the system detects the first valid barge-in event — meaning incoming sound passed VAD, was recognized as speech, and the semantics indicate the user intends to take the floor — the agent should briefly acknowledge it with something like *"Yes?"*, *"Go ahead."*, or a short listening cue tone. This serves two purposes: it signals to the user that the AI has heard the interruption and has paused its prior response, and it avoids moments where both parties wait on each other. After acknowledging, the agent enters a temporary listening window where it expects new input. If the user continues speaking, the AI proceeds normally and handles the new request or clarification. However, if the user does not follow up — for example, noise triggered a barge-in event or the user interrupted impulsively and went silent — the system should not remain stuck waiting indefinitely. Instead, after a reasonable timeout (for example one or two seconds without further speech), the system resumes the original response from where it left off, creating a natural conversational recovery instead of dead air.

Explained to a senior engineer in plain English: Once you promote an interruption to a validated speech/intent event, instead of cutting off output and sitting in an idle listening state, the system should enter a short "interruption-confirmation" state. In that state, playback is paused and a brief acknowledgment is spoken, which cues the user audibly that the floor is theirs. You then keep monitoring the input channel. If the user continues speaking, feed that into ASR and route it through the normal turn-taking pipeline. If no speech resumes within the timeout window, treat the interruption as false or unintentional and resume the original TTS stream. Essentially you’re adding a conversational handshake — stop, acknowledge, wait, decide — rather than halting blindly. This reduces false-positive barge-ins dramatically and maintains conversational flow without awkward silence. The interaction becomes smoother, more human, and robust under real-world conditions, where people cut in, hesitate, change their mind, or simply make noise. The agent feels attentive rather than fragile, because it can pause for a user, recover gracefully, and continue without feeling robotic.
